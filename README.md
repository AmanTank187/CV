## Aman Tank

I am a very determined individual looking for a junior developer role. I am passionate about learning new things and want to be able to follow good quality industry standard practises such as TDD. As a junior I hope to bring my enthusiasm and hard working ethic to your company. I recently finished studying at Makers Academy, A 16 week developer bootcamp where i've been able to improve my knowledge about the fundamentals of software development by getting hands on experience through projects and weekly challenges. I am eager to start working in a professional environment as I believe being involved in real world projects is where I'll improve as a developer the most.

## Experience

#### Group racing game(2018)

* Communicated and organised tasks for the team using a kanban board. 
* Led project reviews to discuss  progress with our supervisor by creating reports. 
* Took part in sprint retrospectives to help improve our processes and support my team. 
* Scoped out tasks using mind maps so the team could identify how much work we could complete. 

#### Battleships game(2017)				
* Built a battleships game which allowed up to two players using C++. 
* Wrote pseudo code for guidance when creating the game. 
* Created a table to keep track of what i tested, the outcome of testing and any improvements i made. 
* Received feedback from the general public to help me make any further improvements
* Used classes to separate the different functionality.

## Skills
* Methdoical Approach to debugging - I feel like i have a good approach when it comes to debugging, i like to read the code i have written outloud and make sure it makes sense to me. I like getting visiblity on my code so i put alot of printed statements in my code to ensure the code is working how i want it to work. Working on projects have really helped me improve this skill by doing it myself and watching team memebers do it was also very helpful. 
* Adapt - Throughout the bootcamp i've improved adapting to new situations as projects can require you to learn new tech stacks and work with different people.
* Positivity - I am always excited to learn and work whether it is independent or within a team. I try to keep a positive mind even when it seems that things are not going right, for example in my last two projects it seemed as if we were working slow and not meeting our targets. In sprint retros when the team didn't feel great i would give a positive outlook and after both projects were completed we as a team were very proud of the final product. 
* Good coding practises - Test driven development is very important to me and i'm always trying to improve my process to make sure my code is robust, I enjoy aiming to keep my test coverage above 95% when i work on a project.
* Commitment - At a young age i decided to commit to a 16 week bootcamp.
