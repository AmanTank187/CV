## Experience

**Primark** (Oct 2018 - Oct 2020)

 Developed great communication skills that will help me confidently communicate with my colleagues in a professional environment. I learnt to manage multiple tasks at once and do them on time, this will help me meet all my deadlines in a software development environment. 

## Skills

#### Working knowledge of ruby and python. 
I have developed my ruby skills by covering multiple ruby lectures on code academy and udemy, after understanding the basics I applied my knowledge to create a rock,paper,scissors and a guessing game in my own time. While on the precourse of makers I have also been able to apply my ruby knowledge by completing mastery quizzes and multiple problems on codewars. While in college i was able to cover the basics of python and create my own ping pong game that allowed you to play against a friend. 

#### Experienced in agile and waterfall methodologies. 
While carrying out my final project in college, me and my group applied agile so we could adapt quickly when the demands of our project were constantly changing. This enabled us to keep up to date with the changes and implement them into our project before deadlines. When i carried out simple college projects where i knew the end goal was going to stay the same i would use the waterfall cycle to organise what stage of the project i was at and had to complete. 

#### Creating documentation such as UML diagrams, reports and gantt charts.
As a part of my final project in college, me and my group had to create a racing game. I would use additional tools such as UML diagrams to visually represent a task we had to complete. We frequently wrote up reports that detailed what went well, problems we faced and what we could do next time in order for the process to be smoother. To ensure the group knew what they had to do and when a task had to be completed, I designed a gantt chart in order to display what tasks are a priority and when a task should be finished. 

#### Organising and overseeing projects.
In my final year project me and my group had to take turns being the project manager, although this was the case I took initiative to be the project manager throughout the whole project. I wanted to deliver the best racing game we could possibly make so I took control and ensured my group were up to date with their tasks. I did this by setting up a whatsapp group dedicated to the project and used a kanban board to assign tasks to individuals who felt they were most effective at completing it.
