## Aman Tank

I am a very determined individual looking for a junior developer role. I am passionate about learning new things and want to be able to write good quality industry standard code.  As a junior I hope to bring my enthusiasm and hard working ethic to your company. I recently finished college where I studied software development and I am eager to start working in a professional environment as I believe being involved in real world projects is where I'll improve as a developer the most.

## Experience

#### Group racing game(2018)					
* Worked in a team of three to design and build a time trial racing game using Unreal engine. 
* Communicated and organised tasks for the team using a kanban board. 
* Led project reviews to discuss  progress with our supervisor by creating reports. 
* Took part in sprint retrospectives to help improve our processes and support my team. 
* Scoped out tasks using mind maps so the team could identify how much work we could complete. 

#### Battleships game(2017)				
* Built a battleships game which allowed up to two players using C++. 
* Wrote pseudo code for guidance when creating the game. 
* Created a table to keep track of what i tested, the outcome of testing and any improvements i made. 
* Received feedback from the general public to help me make any further improvements
* Used classes to separate the different functionality. 

#### Ping pong game(2017)				
•Learned Python from scratch. 
•Created a two player ping pong game using Python. 
•Designed a user friendly interface using the simplegui library.
•Game included two end game conditions which were time and score limited.
•Distributed questionnaires to the general public so I can make improvements to the game. 
•Made a testing plan to check if key features in the game worked correctly.

## Skills

#### Working knowledge of ruby and python. 

I have working knowledge of ruby and python. Using my ruby knowledge I have created a rock,paper ,scissors game and a number guessing game. I’ve also been able to apply my ruby knowledge throughout the makers pre-course by completing the mastery quizzes, solving codewars problems and creating a student directory command line app which is on github. I have also covered python while I was attending college and was able to create a ping pong game that allowed you to play with a friend. 

#### Experienced in agile and waterfall methodologies. 

During my time at college I covered methodologies such as agile and the waterfall cycle so when i'm on a project I can decide which one is more suitable to use.  For my final year project the specification was always changing meaning I decided our group should take an agile approach to allow us to adapt to any changes and still be able to deliver our project in time. I would use the waterfall cycle for simple projects that I would do in my own time such as creating a simple hangman game where I would be able to identify what part of the cycle i was on. 

#### Creating documentation such as UML diagrams, reports and gantt charts.

While carrying out my final year project I decided to use additional tools to represent concepts and help track the overall progression of the project. UML diagrams were used to visually represent a complicated programming concept, this helped other members of the team who weren’t doing much coding still understand how specific functions of the project worked. I would regularly create reports to identify what went well in the project, what did not go well and what can be improved on, all members would do a report and have a meeting to give each other feedback. To keep track of tasks and see how long they would take I created a gantt chart so all members would have a reference to see what tasks they had to do and how long it would take them. 

#### Organising and overseeing projects.

For the final year project I put myself forward to be the project manager. I like taking responsibility and ensured we could deliver the best racing game possible. I used a kanban board and social media to keep everyone on the team up to date with their tasks. If a team member came across issues such as not understanding a piece of code I would explain it to them and make sure they knew what was happening and why it was happening. I helped the group stay happy by letting them have a voice and listening carefully, this created a positive environment which helped us work more efficiently as a team.

## Hobbies

I consider myself a very competitive individual so i like to take part in team based games. I enjoy playing football weekly and playing in video game tournaments in my free time. They both revolve around individual skill and coming together to work as a team which is the reason why I have a passion for both activities.
